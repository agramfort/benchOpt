It involves the definition of objective functions, datasets
and solvers. Once you have defined a benchmark as explained
at :ref:`how`, making comparison figures becomes (hopefully) surprisingly easy!

BenchOpt is typically used through a command line as documented
in :ref:`api_documentation`.

Example
=======

.. code-block::

    $ benchopt run logreg_l2

.. figure:: auto_examples/images/sphx_glr_plot_run_benchmark_001.png
   :target: how.html
   :align: center
   :scale: 80%
